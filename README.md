## WIP [pi-gen][] build of [Pi Scan][]

Start with a clean build (this will take a long time):

```
$ sudo ./build.sh
```

When complete, turn off rebuilds of the intermediate stages:

```
touch stage{0,1,2}/SKIP piscan/SKIP stage2/SKIP_IMAGES piscan/SKIP_IMAGES
```

Then we can iterate on rebuilding the last stage (`piscan-2`) quickly with:

```
sudo CLEAN=1 ./build.sh
```

Completed builds are in ``deploy/image_`date +%F`-pi-scan-finalfinal.zip``
